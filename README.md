# Monitoraiting Patients App

This is a project developed with HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript and React JS that consists of an application for an operating room. The application allows you to fill out a form with the patient's data and the operation, which are validated when submitted. Once submitted, a component with the patient's data is rendered, which can be edited or deleted.

In addition, this data is saved in localstorage so that any changes made are saved. This is useful in case the application is closed or the page is refreshed, as the data will still be available.

I hope you find this project useful!
